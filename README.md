# Tech industry Handbook

This is a collaborative project for folks joining the tech industry written and maintained by people who've been down that
road already and want new folks to have long, successful, safe careers.

Please [edit this document](https://github.com/JackDanger/joining-the-tech-industry/edit/master/README.md) to tell folks
joining their first tech job what to look out for. If you're reading this and you feel any emotions at all then your
input is essential. You can also [contribute anonymously](mailto:tech-industry@jackcanty.com) and we'll add your edits.

# Be prepared

The tech industry is a marvel of innovation and a career here can mean solving the world's problems while making more
than enough money for yourself. It can also mean getting abused and hurt by a system that prioritizes profits and the
status of founders/investors over the sanity and safety of employees. Here are some things you need to know to navigate
your first (or next) job in the tech industry so that you don't leave the field entirely or waste your tears on
organizations that don't deserve them.

## Recruiting
A recruiter's job is to bring in candidates who are likely to pass the company interview process. Interviews are poor
predictors of job success and engineering interviews are even more so. The whole process from a recruiter trying to
bring you in to getting an offer letter can be many weeks long and varies from company to company.

### Engineering Interviews

If you feel dumb in your interview your interviewer has failed and is not somebody you want to work with.
If you feel disrespected during your interview you should stand up and walk out of the company immediately because
that company isn't worth your time and the people you want to work with refuse to work there.
If they ask you lots of algorithmic questions that's not because they think algorithms are essential to your job, they
just have no better idea how to evaluate you.

Go in to your interview with good questions. A sample of things you'll need to know:

* Who was the woman most recently promoted at this company? Can I talk to her?

  An answer that's anything other than "I think her name is X and I'll see if she's available" means you're wasting your
  time.

* What's your parental leave policy?

  Maybe you don't intend to have children soon (or ever) but if the company doesn't value parenting then that's a sign
  they prioritize people who look and act just like the founding team.

* Tell me about the last time you went out with coworkers where nobody drank alcohol.

  It's possible the interviewer cannot think of a time. This is pretty common but they should at least honor the
  question and be a little chagrined to not be able to answer it.

* Can you give me an example of how the company encourages you to develop your career beyond delivering on your
  deadlines?

  There are a hundred ways to grow your career and sending employees to conferences, expensing their books, giving them
  a day (or more) each month just for reading and studying of new techniques are extremely cost-effective ways to
  develop careers. If the company doesn't do any of these it's likely because they don't care, not because they're strapped for cash.

### Exploding offers

When you're given an offer a recruiter may tell you it expires after a period of time. This is a lie. They know that
people can panic and accept a worse offer than they're entitiles to if they aren't given enough time. It's usually
enough to politely say "Please don't use that 'exploding offer' BS with me" and tell them that you're considering the
offer seriously.

### Interview everywhere

You get better at interviewing with each interview. Companies never share information about their candidates with each
other (because you'd be able to sue them). Because of these two facts it's best to interview at many, many places if you
have the time. There's no cost to it aside from your time and you'll just get better. You'll also find some bad
companies reject you and some great companies accept you. The industry is terrible at interviewing.

Once you start at a new job keep interviewing periodically so you always know you have an out if you need it and so you
always know what you're worth. Six months of experience at any company gives you brand new skills that might net you
another $10K/year.

### Promises

During the hiring process a recuirter or manager may make a promise about what team you'll be on, what the company will
do for you, what special affordances they'll make for you, or who you'll be working with. Unless this is in writing and
comes to you from people high-up in the company it's unlikely to be true. The hiring manager may mean well but the next
week their team is re-org'd out of existence and the new manager will not have been told about your expectations.

## Human Resources

The role of the HR department is to prevent the company from getting sued. There are people on these teams who are kind
but their incentive is to prevent you from causing harm to the rest of the company. At best this means they create and
enforce policies where you'd have no reason for a lawsuit. At worst it means they stifle your attempts to fix a
situation or cause you to doubt your sanity.

### HR and Sexual Harassment 

If you're harassed at work you may choose to report it to HR. This is, of course, entirely up to you and you may choose
to avoid reporting for any number of reasons (though we encourage you to tell someone you trust so that you can be taken
seriously and see in your friend's face that the behavior you witnessed is unacceptable). 

If you do choose to report harassment here are some of the situations you may encounter:

* The HR rep tells you that this is the offender's first offence and they won't be taking action

  California state law requires there be an effective response to sexual harassment claims. If no response is made the
  management of the company is *personally*, *criminally* liable. For organizations boasting a flat org chart this means
  the CEO could go to jail. In a more traditionally-structured company this means the people lead in the chain from
  harassee to CEO who first fails to escalate is the one in trouble (or the CEO if it escalates successfully but nothing
  happens).

  The first time someone is reported for sexual harassment they're officially put on notice by the company. At this
  point the company has dealt with the complaint but they've also admitted that there is a problem so if it happens
  again the company must take further action in order to be compliant.
  
  Any company with a decent HR team will know all this and will take a report of sexual harassment very seriously - even
  if it's the first offense. But there are companies who believe it's worth the risk of a lawsuit in order to protect
  valuable employees from accountability and to protect the company brand. If the answer to your report of sexual
  harassment is "this is his first offense" you're at the latter type of company and HR has just lied to your face.

* The HR rep will tell you whether it was really harassment.

  Reality: They'll always say it wasn't. Whether you choose to pursue any further action don't let yourself believe the
  HR rep's evaluation of your experience. You work in tech and you're a smartypants so trust your gut.

* The HR rep will tell you they're "taking care of it"

  You have a right to ask for constant updates on what the organization is doing to protect you and people like you. If
  they don't immediately fire the offender then it's either because they need to do a proper investigation or because
  they intend to do nothing. You have a right to know the means of their investigation, the timeline of it, and the
  outcome. You also have a (legal) right to disagree with the company's conclusion.

## Promotions

It's your manager's job to communicate to you what the expectations of your job are and whether you're meeting those.
It's also their job to clearly communicate to you a path from where you are to the next step in where you want to go. 

### Levels

Most of the larger Bay Area tech companies use a standardized "leveling" chart that roughly describes the levels of
seniority a person might progress through in their career. They start at the entry level where you're purely learning
all the way up to describing the capabilities of someone who invented a programming language or leads engineering at
Google.

These levels are standardized because of a company called
[Radford](https://radford.aon.com/insights/articles/2015/radford-global-job-leveling) that asks companies to assign a
level to every current employee and submit the level information along with associated salary information (anonymized)
to Radford. Radford then issues guidelines based on the current industry pay rates about what a person at a specific
level should be paid.

This works effectively like a [trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_\(business\)) and can lead a company to tell
you they pay $160K for an employee at your level when, in fact, they have enough budget and need that they'd be fine
paying $220K.

#### Know your level

When you join a large company you'll either be assigned the default entry level or, if you've industry experience and/or
made a serious attempt to negotiate, a level that you negotiate with the person doing the hiring.

When you join a small company they probably won't have levels and their evaluation of you will be implicit and entirely
dependent on the particular biases of the person you report to. This could be beneficial if they are happy to help you
rapidly accelerate in a way customized to your particular strengths and weaknesses or could be very harmful if you don't
look and act exactly like the people your manager associates with competence.

Regardless of the leveling system at your company you should always know what it would take for you to advance. It's
your manager's job (one of the very few real tasks they have) to ensure you know what you need to do to get to the next
stage of your career.

### Transitioning to management

There are two parallel tracks in tech: IC (individual contributor) and management.

Small or young companies tend not to distinguish these and becoming a people manager may be your only path to
advancement. If this is the case consider finding a role with exposure to new technologies, a role with greater
responsibility, or hone your skills in your current role waiting for a new opportunity to present itself.

Moving into a people lead role can be painful in most tech companies because the only time a position becomes open is when
there's been enough growth that a manager is needed immediately and there won't be enough time or resources to train
you. If this happens ask for an external management coach to help you figure out this new job. If there's no budget for
that your company is making a terrible mistake. You'll also want to [somebody add new-manager resources here, please!].

### If you can't advance

If your manager doesn't promote you it might be because they are failing at their job and either didn't give you a path
forward or gave you one that the rest of the company won't back and therefore your manager's attempt to promote you
failed. It's also possible there is no headcount at your company for someone of the next level (companies generally
refuse to have all of their employees rated at "extra most senior developer ever") or no budget for raises.

If you find yourself in this situation it's time to start interviewing at other companies (even if you've only been at
your current one a very short while). If your current company values you they'll take a look at any offer letters you
receive and try to offer more money or a different role so you feel valued and can move forward. If they refuse to make
an attempt to compete with another company that wants to hire you then they don't value you and you should quit
regardless.

Note: You may feel loyalty to your employer and this is noble but that loyalty is misplaced. Be loyal to yourself and to
those who come after you who will see your example. Tech companies, though full of well-intentioned people, are machines
that extract the time and brainpower from employees to deliver customer value to then, in turn, deliver shareholder
value and, often, increase the personal status of the founders and investors. This may sound cynical but this system
works really well for innovating in technology - just as long as you don't assume your employer cares for you. If the
people you work for care about you you'll know it in your bones and when you need to leave they'll call around to find a
great position for you and they'll help you transition.


### Advancing for women and other minorities

[PLEASE ADD TO THIS SECTION]

## Using privilege wisely

If you have [white privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_privilege) (whether you feel like you want it or not) or if you have [male privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_privilege) then you will have countless more opportunities and access in the tech industry than your peers who don't have one or either. There are many other [forms of privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_\(social_inequality\)) as well and just about everybody has some.

### First: you're okay

Nobody benefits from [white guilt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_guilt) and one unnecessary burden on marginalized groups is that when they point out the imbalance of power they first have to face the defensiveness of the empowered people before even addressing the real problem. One of the simplest ways we can help marginalized folks is to simply admit to our privilege and refuse to be ashamed of it. If you say "I'm a straight white male and that gives me lots of advantages" you're not bragging (hopefully), you're just admitting to what everybody else knows and sees every day.

### Identifying exclusive situations

If you're white or male you'll definitely find yourself in meetings where everybody else is also white or male (or both). It may be outside your power to fix this but it's entirely within your means to raise your hand and say "I'd just like to point out that as far as I can tell there are no women in this room" (or whatever other group(s) happen to be missing). Privilege hides itself so unless people are told that situations like an all-male or all-white meeting are abnormal they likely won't notice.

### Championing marginalized groups in your org

You can probably befriend every minority who works with you in an afternoon. And even if you don't become friends it takes hardly any time at all to learn someone's name and role and ask them what kind of work they would like to be doing more of. Once you know this you can keep your eyes open for roles of that kind in the company and mention the name of someone who's traditionally overlooked to whomever has the power to help that person.

### Taking people seriously

A very simple but and effective way you can support your peers who lack one of the privileges you have is to take them seriously when they tell you about something that happened to them that would never have happened to you. If you hear a story like this know that it's an honor and it reflects that you've seemed like a safe person. So even if you can see a way to play devil's advocate just believe the words they say and let them know you'll be there to listen the next time, too. There are more than enough devils already.

### Respecting exclusive spaces

There are email lists and Slack groups and monthly meetings where members of various marginalized groups gather to support each other and talk about their experience. Some of these welcome anybody who's interested and some don't, depending on if the group is meant to be externally or internally helpful. Ask if you can join and if they answer is "yes" then attend and practice speaking far less than you normally would. If the answer is "no" then respect that and start defending that "no" to people who try to force their way in. Those of us with enormous privilege have a hard time accepting that we can be denied access (even to a group that in no way involves us) and you can be a buffer against jerks trying to ruin a good thing for people who need it.

### Modifying our language

Language is culture and our culture has various cruelties embedded in it. One of the biggest of these is the assumption that male is the default gender. The "[universal he])(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they)" is merely an encoding of this patriarchal norm into everyday language. By [avoiding the use](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/01/12/hacking-inclusion-by-customizing-a-slack-bot/) of terms that reflect inquitable concepts we make a little portion of our workplace safer for people who don't belong to traditionally-empowered groups.
