# Tech industry Handbook

This is a collaborative project for women and other minorities joining the tech industry by people who've been down that
road already and want them to succeed.

Please [edit this document](https://github.com/JackDanger/joining-the-tech-industry/edit/master/README.md) to show folks joining their
first tech job what to look out for. If you're reading this and you feel any emotions at all then your input is
essential. If you'd rather contribute anonymously email
[tech-industry@jackcanty.com](mailto:tech-industry@jackcanty.com) and we'll add your edits.

# Be prepared

The tech industry is a marvel of innovation and a career here can mean solving the world's problems while making more
than enough money. It can also mean getting abused and hurt by a system that prioritizes profits and the status the
founders/investors over the sanity and safety of employees. Here are some things you need to know to navigate your first
(or next) job in the tech industry so that you don't leave the field entirely or waste your tears on organizations that
don't deserve them.

## Human Resources

The role of the HR department is to prevent the company from getting sued. There are people on these teams who are kind
but their incentive is to prevent you from causing harm to the rest of the company. At best this means they create and
enforce policies where you'd have no chance at a lawsuit. At worst it means they stifle your attempts to fix a
situation.


### HR and Sexual Harassment 

If you're harassed at work you may choose to report it to HR. This is, of course, entirely up to you and you may choose
to avoid reporting for any number of reasons (though we encourage you to tell someone you trust so that you can be taken
seriously and see in your friend's face that the behavior you witnessed is unacceptable). 

If you do choose to report harassment here are some of the situations you may encounter:

* The HR rep tells you that this is the offender's first offence and they won't be taking action

  California state law requires there be an effective response to sexual harassment claims. If no response is made the
  management of the company is *personally*, *criminally* liable. For organizations boasting a flat org chart this means
  the CEO could go to jail. In a more traditionally-structured company this means the people lead in the chain from
  harassee to CEO who first fails to escalate is the one in trouble (or the CEO if it escalates successfully but nothing
  happens).

  The first time someone is reported for sexual harassment they're officially put on notice by the company. At this
  point the company has dealt with the complaint but they've also admitted that there is a problem so if it happens
  again the company must take further action in order to be compliant.
  
  Any company with a decent HR team will know all this and will take a report of sexual harassment very seriously - even
  if it's the first offense. But there are companies who believe it's worth the risk of a lawsuit in order to protect
  valuable employees from accountability and to protect the company brand. If the answer to your report of sexual
  harassment is "this is his first offense" you're at the latter type of company and HR has just lied to your face.

* The HR rep will tell you whether it was really harassment.

  Reality: They'll always say it wasn't. Whether you choose to pursue any further action don't let yourself believe the
  HR rep's evaluation of your experience. You work in tech and you're a smartypants so trust your gut.

* The HR rep will tell you they're "taking care of it"

  You have a right to ask for constant updates on what the organization is doing to protect you and people like you. If
  they don't immediately fire the offender then it's either because they need to do a proper investigation or because
  they intend to do nothing. You have a right to know the means of their investigation, the timeline of it, and the
  outcome. You also have a (legal) right to disagree with the company's conclusion.

## Promotions

It's your manager's job to communicate to you what the expectations of your job are and whether you're meeting those.
It's also their job to clearly communicate to you a path from where you are to the next step in where you want to go. 

### Levels

Most of the larger Bay Area tech companies use a standardized "leveling" chart that roughly describes the levels of
seniority a person might progress through in their career. They start at the entry level where you're purely learning
all the way up to describing the capabilities of someone who invented a programming language or leads engineering at
Google.

These levels are standardized because of a company called
[Radford](https://radford.aon.com/insights/articles/2015/radford-global-job-leveling) that asks companies to assign a
level to every current employee and submit the level information along with associated salary information (anonymized)
to Radford. Radford then issues guidelines based on the current industry pay rates about what a person at a specific
level should be paid.

This works effectively like a [trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_\(business\)) and can lead a company to tell
you they pay $160K for an employee at your level when, in fact, they have enough budget and need that they'd be fine
paying $220K.

#### Know your level

When you join a large company you'll either be assigned the default entry level or, if you've industry experience and/or
made a serious attempt to negotiate, a level that you negotiate with the person doing the hiring.

When you join a small company they probably won't have levels and their evaluation of you will be implicit and entirely
dependent on the particular biases of the person you report to. This could be beneficial if they are happy to help you
rapidly accelerate in a way customized to your particular strengths and weaknesses or could be very harmful if you don't
look and act exactly like the people your manager associates with competence.

Regardless of the leveling system at your company you should always know what it would take for you to advance. It's
your manager's job (one of the very few real tasks they have) to ensure you know what you need to do to get to the next
stage of your career.

### Transitioning to management

There are two parallel tracks in tech: IC (individual contributor) and management.

Small or young companies tend not to distinguish these and becoming a people manager may be your only path to
advancement. If this is the case consider finding a role with exposure to new technologies, a role with greater
responsibility, or hone your skills in your current role waiting for a new opportunity to present itself.

Moving into a people lead role is difficult in most tech companies because the only time a position becomes open is when
there's been enough growth that a manager is needed immediately and there won't be enough time or resources to train
you. If this happens ask for an external management coach to help you figure out this new job. If there's no budget for
that your company is making a terrible mistake. You'll also want to [somebody add new-manager resources here, please!].

### If you can't advance

If your manager doesn't promote you it might be because they are failing at their job and either didn't give you a path
forward or gave you one that the rest of the company won't back and therefore your manager's attempt to promote you
failed. It's also possible there is no headcount at your company for someone of the next level (companies generally
refuse to have all of their employees rated at "extra most senior developer ever") or no budget for raises.

If you find yourself in this situation it's time to start interviewing at other companies (even if you've only been at
your current one a very short while). If your current company values you they'll take a look at any offer letters you
receive and try to offer more money or a different role so you feel valued and can move forward. If they refuse to make
an attempt to compete with another company that wants to hire you then they don't value you and you should quit
regardless.

Note: You may feel loyalty to your employer and this is noble but that loyalty is misplaced. Be loyal to yourself and to
those who come after you who will see your example. Tech companies, though full of well-intentioned people, are machines
that extract the time and brainpower from employees to deliver customer value to then, in turn, deliver shareholder
value and, often, increase the personal status of the founders and investors. This may sound cynical but this system
works really well for innovating in technology - just as long as you don't assume your employer cares for you. If the
people you work for care about you you'll know it in your bones and when you need to leave they'll call around to find a
great position for you and they'll help you transition.


### Advancing for women and other minorities

If you have just graduated college or you're working in an entry-level position you may not observe any sexism or racism
in your organization. Once you advance it's possible the people you've been working with were comfortable with you when
they had more power and prestige but one or more of them are threatened by you.

If you're a women or other minority you'll need support from empowered people outside your team and from outside your
company. What you want to look for are coaches (people who know you and want you to succeed) and champions (coaches who
also are willing to use their power on your behalf). You'll hear a lot of talk of mentorship but most companies don't
offer any real mentorship and don't tell you how to take advantage of it when it's offered. Focus instead on collecting
as many coaches as you can and try to have at least one champion inside your organization when you are ready to advance.

This shouldn't be so hard but it is. It's super hard. Luckily, there's a huge network of people who're willing to step
into the fight and help you if they know you need it.
